# SpaceSurvivor-libGDX

This is my first game made using libGDX. I made it primarily to learn the basics of libGDX and to go throught the process of publishing an app on the google play store:
[Space Survivor - Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eobgames.spacesurvivor.android)

The structure of the code is based on the book [Learning Libgdx Game Development](https://www.packtpub.com/game-development/learning-libgdx-game-development)
I think the structure is a bit overkill for such a simple game, but it allows for scalability and will come in handy for my other libGDX projects.
